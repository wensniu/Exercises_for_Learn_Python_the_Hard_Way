Rules for If-Statements and Loops

Rules for If-Statements:
Every if-statement must have an else.
If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies.
Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep.
Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.


Rules for Loops:
Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This only applies to Python; other languages are different.
Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.
